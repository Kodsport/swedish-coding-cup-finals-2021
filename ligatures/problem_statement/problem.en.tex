\problemname{Ligatures}
Vivi designs fonts. Blah blah ligatures.

Given a list of suggested sets of ligatures, compute the number of ligature occurrences
across the corpus for each suggestion.

\section*{Input}
The first line of the input contains three integers:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $N$: the size of the corpus ($1 \le N \le 10^6$),
  \item $Q$: the number of suggestions ($1 \le Q \le 10^5$),
  \item $K$: the number of ligatures for each suggestion ($1 \le K \le 20$).
\end{itemize}

The second line of the input contains a string with $N$ characters from \texttt{a-z}: the corpus.

The next $Q$ lines each contain $2K$ characters: the ligature suggestions.
The first two characters make up the first suggested ligature, the second two characters make up the second one, and so on.
No character pair will occur twice within a suggestion.

\section*{Output}
For each suggested ligature set, output a line with the number of ligature occurrences within the corpus,
if the corpus is read from left to right and the given ligatures are applied.

\section*{Scoring}
Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points.
To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group.
Your final score will be the maximum score of a single submission.
